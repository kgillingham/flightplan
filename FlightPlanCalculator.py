# Program Purpose and Use:
# Calulates the flight plan of an aerial photography remote sensing mission
# calculates the location, direction, flying height, and number of flight lines 
# required to photograph an area
# Input in the form of a csv file and also keyboard input of camera type
# Outputs displayed on screen and in a CSV file

# Program Summary:

# Assumptions Affecting Program Strcture:
# It is assumed that terrain elevation does not change over the study area (we use "Average Terrain Elevation")
# It is assumed that the flying height of the aircraft stays constant over the study area.
# It is only possible to input a csv with one record whereas in flight planning, multiple flights would be planned at once.

# Special Cases and Known Problems:
# During data validation, if the inputs are not suitable, the program ends. 
# This causes an issue if the FlightPlan-(CameraType)Output.csv is not deleted before the program is run again as
# the program will write a second row of headers, followed by the data inputs and calculations.

# Inputs:
# Camera Type (Digital/Film)
# Focal Length
# Average Terrain Elevation
# Desired Endlap
# Desired Sidelap
# Aircraft Speed
# Four Pairs of Coordinates representing the 4 corners of study area
# Film Format (Film Only)
# Scale (Film Only)
# Across Track Array Pixel Amount (Digital Only)
# Along Track Array Pixel Amount (Digital Only)
# Physical Pixel Size (Digital Only)
# Ground Sampling Distance (Digital Only)

# Outputs:
# Flying Height Above Terrain
# Flying Height Above Sea Level
# Miniumum Number of Flight Lines
# Distance Between Flight Lines
# Total Number of Photos
# Total Number of Photos Per Line
# Starting Coordinates of Each Flight Line
