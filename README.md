Flight Plan Calculator - GEOM 67 Group 6 Final Project

This program calculates flight paths for your aerial photography mission. 
You will notice two input templates: digital and film.
The parameters required from you are slightly different based on which format you pick. 
Make sure you input the correct values for the units specified in the template.

The program can handle multiple scenarios. When you input multiple rows
make sure there are no empty rows between them.

The output data will be in a file called FlightPlan-DigitalOutput.csv or FlightPlan-FilmOutput.csv.


**** NOTE FOR KAREN: ****
The input CSV's already have some test values in them. You can either add to it or replace them with your own.
